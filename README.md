# PL
A lisp-style programming language written in python.

Eg.

|Lisp-Style                    |C-style       |
|------------------------------|--------------|
|`(print "Hello, World!")`     |`print("Hello, World!")`|

## FizzBuzz in PL
```
x = (int (input "FizzBuzz Enter an Integer > "))
(for y = 1; y <= x; ++y) {
  (if x % 3 == 0) {
    (print "Fizz")
  }
  (if x % 5 == 0) {
    (print "Buzz"
  }
}
(input)
```
Note: This is a first idea, so the final result could look quite different.
