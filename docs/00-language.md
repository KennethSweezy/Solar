## Solar Overview

Solar is a language designed for working out equations, as it works out the functions that are inside the most functions, meaning you can use BODMAS to work out equasions.

### Naming Rules 

Solar is case-**in**sensitive, meaning if I had a variable called `Hi`, it would be the same as `hi`, but even though it is case-insensitive, you should probably stick to the following naming rules, though you do not have to:

- Use Camelcase for Variables. Eg `veryGood`
- If you have defined a variable as `veryGood`, avoid prining the variable as `VERYGOOD`
- Avoid using words that don't make sense as variable names. Eg `cnysT` (With the exception of `a` to `z` and variables that begin with `$`)

List of Characters you can use in variable names: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm$ **&#42;&#47;&#43;&#45;&#37;&#60;&#62;&#61;**

__Bold Characters__: Don't use these in single letter variables eg. `>`
