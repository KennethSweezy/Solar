## Solar Overview

Solar is a language designed for working out equations, as it works out the functions that are inside the most functions, meaning you can use BODMAS to work out equasions.

### Naming Rules 

Solar is case-sensitive, meaning if I had a variable called `Hi`, it would **not** be the same as `hi`.
The naming rules below are recommended for consistency, but not required:

- Use camelCase for Variables. Eg `veryGood`
- Avoid using words that don't make sense as variable names. Eg `cnysT` (With the exception of `a` to `z` and variables that begin with `$`)

List of Characters you can use in variable names: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm$ `!>=<+-/*%`

`Code Characters`: Don't use these in single letter variables eg. `>`
